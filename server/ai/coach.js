Candidate data:
- Target role: ${role}
- Sessions completed: ${sessions.length}
- Average score across all answers: ${avgScore ?? "N/A"}/10
- Recurring weaknesses (most frequent first): ${topWeaknesses.length ? topWeaknesses.join(", ") : "none yet"}
- Demonstrated strengths: ${topStrengths.length ? topStrengths.join(", ") : "none yet"}

Your task — think step by step:
1. Identify the single biggest gap holding this candidate back
2. Design one targeted drill question that directly addresses it
3. Give a concrete, actionable tip for that specific question
4. Suggest 3 next actions to improve over the next week

  "drill_tip": "One concrete sentence: how to approach this question well",
